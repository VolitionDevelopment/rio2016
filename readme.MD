#Rio 2016

The theme of this project is the 2016 Olympics that are taking place in Brazil in August. In this site we have the countdown to the event, coverage of local tourism and news articles, olympic competition around the world, and featured athletes.

##Components:

*Modified the carousel style from the default
*Used a Bootstrap fixed nav-bar for the menu and site navigation
*Nav-bar is responsive across all devices
*Background images are responsive across all devices

###jQuery
